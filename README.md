## Hi! I'm Bob Holden, aka EAWF.
### Ancient History
* With roots reaching back to 1971, I've been operating EAWF since 1979, providing goods and services to customers of all types, large and small business, government, and non-profits.
### Present Activities
* EAWF is a managed VPS Hosting Company dba EAWF LLC providing affordable web domain hosting for primarily small business and individuals.
* Phoenix Crypto Coach is a division of EAWF that provides technical support to businesses and individuals who are looking to add bitcoin to their Invoice Remittance systems.
