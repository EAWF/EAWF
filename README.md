## Hi! I'm Bob Holden, aka EAWF.
### Ancient History
* With roots reaching back to 1971, I've been operating EAWF since 1979, providing goods and services to customers of all types, large and small business, government, and non-profits.
* Schooled as a Glaze Chemist and Ceramicist, life handed me a curve ball and educated me about the concept of expendible income, which forced me to take a hard right turn and look at new-fangled ceramic chips that could do stuff electronically, which introduced me to programming, and I've been on the same road ever since.
### Present Activities
* EAWF is a managed VPS Hosting Company dba EAWF LLC providing affordable web domain hosting for primarily small business and individuals.
* Phoenix Crypto Coach is a division of EAWF that provides education to businesses and individuals who are looking to add bitcoin to their Invoice Remittance systems.
