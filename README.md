### Current Projects
* :construction: Adding features and content to [EAWF.com][website].
* :construction: [MIT App Inventor][AI2] Working on various bitcoin related projects to help anyone write an app that accepts payments in bitcoin.
* :seedling: I'm learning more about how to work with GitHub and its features, like this page!
### My Businesses
* <img src="https://github.com/EAWF/EAWF/blob/master/images/logo.png" valign=middle height=17>[EAWF][website] is now a Bitcoin Consulting/Mentoring Service managed by me, which essentially took over the Phoenix Crypto Coach business described below. I teach/mentor individuals how to use bitcoin safely and securely in their daily lives. A specialty is getting small business web sites set up to receive bitcoin directly without third party support entities.
* <img src="https://github.com/EAWF/EAWF/blob/master/images/logo.png" valign=middle height=17>EAWF is again a managed VPS Hosting Company providing affordable web domain hosting for primarily small business and individuals. The business was closed effective October 31st, 2021 due to increasing governmental and banking cartel mismanagement which upset the delicate balance of the business and financial world as well as my personal business model, however, the current world is dictating that I should stay, nay, expand the business so that I can continue to serve customer demand.
### Github Repositories
* :construction: [BTC_Toolbox][Toolbox], a public GitHub repository of easy to use and understand tools you can use to build your own bitcoin paywall without requiring confusing libraries or rent-seeking third-party corporations. Effective September 2025, the web site will be going down and the domain name discontinued. Contact me if you're interested in taking the project on.
### About Me
* Interests:
  - :bank: I'm a HUGE proponent of Bitcoin and of educating people how to become their own bank and preserve their wealth by using <img src="https://github.com/EAWF/EAWF/blob/master/images/btc.svg" valign=middle height=17>itcoin!
  - :musical_note: I'm an amateur musician, and play keyboards, guitar, mandolin, bouzouki, harmonica, dulcimers, penny whistle, accordian, puny tune, jew's harp, and concertina.
  - :tophat: I'm an an amateur magician with an ancient bag of tricks.
* Ancient History
  - With roots reaching back to 1971, between August of 1979 until December of 2021 I owned and operated EAWF, providing goods and services to customers of all types, large and small business, government, and non-profits.
  - Schooled as a Glaze Chemist/Ceramicist, life handed me a curve ball and educated me about the concept of customer expendible income, which forced me to take a hard right turn and look at new-fangled ceramic-like chips that could do stuff electronically, which introduced me to programming, and I've been on the same road ever since.
 * **Fun facts:** 
   - :zap: Won a World Book Encyclopedia as a kid for asking a question of [Ask Andy]. :zap:
   - :zap: As a Systems Analyst, I have built and installed more systems that put me out of work more times than anyone I know. :zap:
