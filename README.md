### About Me
* Interests:
  - :bank: I'm a HUGE proponent of Bitcoin and of educating people how to become their own bank and preserve their wealth by using [<img src="https://github.com/EAWF/EAWF/blob/master/images/btc.svg" valign=middle height=17>itcoin!][PCC]
  - :musical_note: I'm an amateur musician, and play keyboards, guitar, mandolin, bouzouki, harmonica, mountain and hammered dulcimers, penny whistle, accordian, puny tune, jew's harp, and concertina.
  - :tophat: I'm an an amateur magician.
* Ancient History
  - With roots reaching back to 1971, I've been operating EAWF since 1979, providing goods and services to customers of all types, large and small business, government, and non-profits.
  - Schooled as a Glaze Chemist and Ceramicist, life handed me a curve ball and educated me about the concept of expendible income, which forced me to take a hard right turn and look at new-fangled ceramic chips that could do stuff electronically, which introduced me to programming, and I've been on the same road ever since.
 * **Fun facts:** 
   - :zap: Won a World Book Encyclopedia as a kid for asking a question of [Ask Andy]. :zap:
   - :zap: As a Systems Analyst, I have built and installed more systems that put me out of work more times than anyone I know. :zap:
