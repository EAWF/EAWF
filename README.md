## EAWF, aka Bob Holden.
### Ancient History
* With roots reaching back to 1971, I've been operating EAWF since 1979, providing goods and services to customers of all types, large and small business, government, and non-profits.
* Schooled as a Glaze Chemist and Ceramicist, life handed me a curve ball and educated me about the concept of expendible income, which forced me to take a hard right turn and look at new-fangled ceramic chips that could do stuff electronically, which introduced me to programming, and I've been on the same road ever since.
### My Businesses
* EAWF is a managed VPS Hosting Company dba EAWF LLC providing affordable web domain hosting for primarily small business and individuals.
* Phoenix Crypto Coach is a division of EAWF that provides education to businesses and individuals who are looking to add bitcoin to their Invoice Remittance systems.
### Current Projects 
*  :construction: [Bitcoin_Merchant's_Toolbox][Toolbox], a public GitHub repository of easy to use and understand tools you can use to build your own bitcoin paywall without requiring confusing libraries or rent-seeking third-party corporations. Use the QR Code at the right to donate some BTC to the project.
* :seedling: I'm learning more about how to work with GitHub and its features, like this page!
### About Me
